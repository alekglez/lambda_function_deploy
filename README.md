###### Deploying Lambda Functions written in Python that use custom dependencies not included in AWS Lambda Runtime for Python with Terraform as Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

###### The purpose of this example project is: create a Lambda Function that will be activated by AWS S3 Event trowed when an video in “.mp4” format is copied in an S3 Bucket. The Lambda Function will notify us calling an mocked REST API endpoint.
